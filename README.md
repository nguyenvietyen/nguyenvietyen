## 👋 Hey, I'm Viet

I specialized on engineering spacecraft software (🛰️ and 🚀). Especially the ingenious kind with long mission spans, fault-tolerant autonomy and probabilistically analyzed self-healing subsystems. 

Now I've taken all that to build the world's best **earned media** platform using distributed big data, probabilistic AI and SaaS principles. 

- 👨🏻‍💻 I'm the [CTO at Hypefactors](https://hypefactors.com/da/investor-3/)
- 🧑🏿‍🤝‍🧑🏾 I love building amazing tech products with great teams
- ⚔️ My weapons of choice are **Scala**, **probabilistic programming**, **theorem proving**, **linear programming** and **transformer ML models**
- ⌨️ Fun fact: I type on a [Kinesis Advantage](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2-dvorak/) with a custom [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) layout. I've switched out its factory firmware with a hard-wired Arduino Pro Micro and [QMK](https://qmk.fm/). Check out my [mod](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/9944/).
